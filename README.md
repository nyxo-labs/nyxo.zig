## 🎯 Philosophy

**When performance matters, you need native code.** Built for high-throughput Discord applications that handle thousands of events per second.

**Core Principles:**
- 🔥 **Native performance** - compiled to machine code
- 🛡️ **Memory safe** - zero leaks, zero crashes
- ⚡ **Cross-platform** - compile for any OS from any OS
- 📦 **Self-contained** - no runtime dependencies
- 🎯 **Type safe** - catch errors at compile time
- 🚀 **Zero-cost abstractions** - pay only for what you use

## 🚧 Development Status

**Early Development** - This project is currently in active development. APIs and features are subject to change.

The library aims to provide a complete Discord API implementation with focus on:
- WebSocket gateway handling
- REST API coverage
- Event-driven architecture
- Memory-efficient design
- Cross-compilation support
